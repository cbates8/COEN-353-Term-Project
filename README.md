This project is part of the term project for COEN 353 - Trust and Privacy in Online Social Networks.

The goal of the term project is to:

1. Investigate potential online social network security, trust and privacy problems.
2. Identify a specific problem, then conduct literature survey on related work (i.e., what has been done to address this problem).
3. Propose potential solutions to address the problem.
4. Do some basic experiments to test the solution
